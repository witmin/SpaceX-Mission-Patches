# SpaceX Mission Patches 

![SpaceX Mission Patches 2006-2018](https://github.com/witmin/vue-cli-axios-with-spacex-api/blob/master/public/space-x-mission-patches-2021.png "Screenshot of the mission patches")

This is a single page site made in vue-cli v3 with data from SpaceX data API:
[https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

At the beginning, I just want to use the data and practice vue-cli v3 and axios. Then I found the patches images are so beatiful. They are more than graphics.
